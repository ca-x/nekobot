# Progress Log

## 2026-02-15

- Initialized planning artifacts for provider DB migration task.
- Inspected current provider backend/frontend implementation paths.
- Confirmed provider CRUD currently depends on config file persistence and draft-based frontend flow.
- Next: implement DB-backed provider store and wire into WebUI handlers.
- Implemented `pkg/providerstore` with SQLite provider CRUD and runtime config sync.
- Wired provider store into WebUI APIs and gateway/CLI startup module graphs.
- Updated dashboard provider dialog: clicking dialog Apply now directly persists provider changes.
- Adjusted storage to reuse the existing single DB file `tool_sessions.db` per user request.
- Verification: `go test ./...` passed.
- Refactored Ent location to a single shared path: moved generated code from `pkg/toolsessions/ent` to `pkg/storage/ent` and updated all imports.
- Re-ran verification after Ent refactor: `go test ./...` passed.
- Implemented runtime config DB store (`config_sections`) on shared `tool_sessions.db` and startup overlay logic.
- Migrated WebUI save paths for init password, channel updates, global config save, and chat routing persistence from file writes to DB writes.
- Added config DB store tests and verified with `go test ./...`.
- Updated `config/config.example.json`, `pkg/config/config.example.json`, and `docs/CONFIG.md` to match latest minimal-file + DB-runtime behavior.
- Replanned config UX: switched dashboard Config from whole-document JSON editing to section-scoped editing with section selector/reset/save.
- Removed outdated provider-in-config snippets from README/docs and aligned examples to bootstrap-only config.
- Added WebUI config section into `/api/config` read/write path and persisted via DB section storage.
- Validation run: `go test ./...` passed.

## 2026-02-28

- Completed memory storage abstraction hardening with `MemoryBackend` implementations for file/db/kv/noop.
- Fixed file backend I/O in `pkg/agent/memory_backend.go` to use `os.MkdirAll` + `os.ReadFile` + `os.IsNotExist` while keeping atomic writes.
- Fixed `NewMemoryStore` fallback typing in `pkg/agent/memory.go` to safely degrade to noop backend when file backend init fails.
- Added `pkg/agent/memory_backend_test.go` to verify KV backend selection, DB backend selection, and KV-unavailable fallback to file backend.
- Verification run: `go test ./pkg/agent ./pkg/config ./cmd/nekobot` passed.
- Added ACP stdio entrypoint command `nekobot acp` with FX wiring and lifecycle management in `cmd/nekobot/acp.go`.
- Extended ACP session state and adapter mapping so `session/new` `mcpServers` are converted into `config.MCPServerConfig` and stored per ACP session.
- Updated blades orchestrator tool resolver path to honor ACP session-level MCP overrides, while keeping existing provider fallback and tool execution flow unchanged.
- Added MCP transport compatibility for ACP `sse` by mapping to blades HTTP transport and expanded config validation to accept `sse` transport values.
- Added ACP adapter tests for session creation/mode/cancel/prompt validation and MCP mapping coverage in `pkg/agent/acp_adapter_test.go`.
- Added ACP `session/update` bridge in adapter `Prompt` flow to emit agent text chunks via ACP connection while preserving existing provider fallback and tool execution semantics.
- Wired ACP adapter to `AgentSideConnection` in CLI startup so session update notifications are available in real ACP runtime.
- Expanded ACP adapter tests to cover session update emission, session update failure/cancel handling, and connection-detach behavior.
- Verification run: `go test ./pkg/agent ./pkg/config ./cmd/nekobot` passed.
- Added ACP `session/load` support in adapter with absolute CWD validation, in-memory session bootstrap, and per-session MCP override mapping.
- Updated ACP initialize capability to advertise `loadSession=true` so ACP clients can restore existing session IDs.
- Added ACP adapter tests for `Initialize` loadSession capability plus `LoadSession` success and validation failure paths.
- Added ACP session model state exposure in `session/new` and `session/load` responses to reflect the session’s active model.

- Verification run: `go test -count=1 ./pkg/agent ./pkg/config ./cmd/nekobot` passed.
- Added trailing user-message dedup normalization in `pkg/agent/context.go` (`BuildMessages`) to avoid double-injecting the current prompt when callers pre-append user turns.
- Applied the same trailing user-message normalization in `pkg/agent/blades_runtime.go` before hydrating blades session history, keeping blades runtime behavior aligned with legacy prompt construction semantics.
- Added regression tests in `pkg/agent/agent_test.go` for trailing-current-user dedup and non-matching history preservation.

- Fixed runtime Ent schema migration race by serializing `EnsureRuntimeEntSchema` calls with a package-level mutex in `pkg/config/runtime_client.go`.
- Added regression test `TestEnsureRuntimeEntSchemaConcurrentCalls` in `pkg/config/db_store_test.go` to verify concurrent schema init no longer fails.
- Verification run: `go test -count=1 ./pkg/config ./pkg/cron` passed.
- Verification run: `go test -count=1 ./...` passed.

- Verification run: `go test -count=1 ./...` passed.
- Wired `Agent.callLLMWithFallback` to provider failover semantics (`providers.ClassifyError` + shared `CooldownTracker`) so retriable failures continue fallback and non-retriable format errors fail fast.
- Added provider cooldown skip behavior in agent fallback path, including contextual logging for skip reason and remaining cooldown window.
- Added agent failover regression tests for retriable fallback continuation, non-retriable short-circuit behavior, and cooldown-based skip on subsequent attempts (`pkg/agent/agent_test.go`).
- Added provider failover/cooldown regression tests covering cooldown skipping, non-retriable stop, reason tracking, all-cooldown exhaustion, and 24h failure-window reset (`pkg/providers/loadbalancer_test.go`).

- Aligned blades runtime tool error semantics with legacy orchestrator: tool execution failures now return `Error: ...` tool results instead of aborting the whole run.
- Added blades runtime regression tests for tool-error result fallback and role/parts mapping (`pkg/agent/agent_test.go`).
- Updated architecture docs for Cron capabilities to reflect DB-backed persistence and run-now support.

- Verification run: `go test ./cmd/nekobot` passed.
- Verification run: `go test ./...` passed.
- Fixed blades tool-result history conversion in `pkg/agent/blades_runtime.go`: when hydrating prior `RoleTool` messages, each `blades.ToolPart` now maps to its own `providers.UnifiedMessage` so multiple tool results in one blades message are preserved for provider context reconstruction.

  - `TestBladesModelProvider_ConvertMessagesPreservesMultipleToolResults`
  - `TestBladesModelProvider_ConvertMessagesToolFallbackToRequest`
- Verification run: `go test ./pkg/agent` passed.
- Verification run: `go test ./...` passed.
